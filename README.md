## About me

Hello. I work for [Universal Health Services, inc.](https://www.uhsinc.com/) in the *Digital Marketing Department*. We are a small, talented and well integrated team working out of King of Prussia, Pennsylvania. On a good day, I split my time between exceeding expectations and finding methods to minimize future efforts. Always on the hunt for the perfectly optimized work flow or more efficient tooling, I configure and test software for web solutions. Below you will find a list of projects I am [currently working on](#current "current projects") and have [recently completed](#recent "recently completed projects").

When I am not banging on the keyboard for UHS, I am relaxing with my wife and our dog in Wayne, PA. *lil' Wayne,* is a small town with a big personality, due west of Philadelphia. I get outside as much as possible, riding the 45 minute commute to work by bicycle. Weekends, I take a more leasurly route through the surrounding country side. Occasonaly, I get the chance to play music on the modular synth or listen to tracks from my collection of 45's. Mostly Dub Reggae, my favorite!

Thank you for your interest and check out my [resume](https://scudderstevens.me/resume.md) for additional details.
