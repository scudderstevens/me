    fullDescription: "As pioneers in tax automation, customers have relied on Vertex to deliver trusted tax solutions for decades. Tax compliance and research has evolved since the pre-digital days when Vertex first started. During the existence of an Innovation department at Vertex, I have been fortunate to have been involved in many projects. To date, there have only been two (2) projects to have successfully progressed through the stage gate process. My work producing prototypes, conducting interviews and supporting internal peer reviews, I have contributed to a Team effort ensuring a solutionâ€™s technical viability and strategy validity. Currently, one project is in the MVP stage and the second is approaching the General Availability release phase."

    fullDescription: "The Universal Directory provides a single source of truth for multiple web solutions; this allows us to maintain consistent data across Universal Health Services' suite of digital products, thereby reducing code redundancy and preventing software bugs. All healthcare verticals, locations, general medical education consortiums, healthcare provider profiles and service integrations are managed from one universal resource. This massive project evolved from a single Proof-of-Concept; a Sanity solution defined to be a limited use case and test bed. The current, more comprehensive version continues to be refined as it is integrated into new projects. The platform now powers web sites across all healthcare verticals with a custom WordPress plugin and Drupal module. An application programming interface (API) allows the Uni-Dir to manage internal (UHS corporate) and external service integrations."
