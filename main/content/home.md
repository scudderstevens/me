    fullDescription: 'The Universal Directory provides a single source of truth for multiple web solutions. In turn maintaining data consistantcy across Universal Health Services' suite of digital products, reducing code redundancy and squishing software bugs. All healthcare verticals, locations, general medical education consortiums, healthcare provider profiles and service integrations are managed from one universal resource. This massive project evolved from a single Proof-of-Concept; a Sanity solution defined to be a limited use case and test bed. The current, more comprehense version, continues to be refined as it is integrated into new projects. The platform now powers web sites across all healthcare verticals with a custom WordPress plugin and Drupal module. A application programming interface (API) allows the Uni-Dir to manage internal (UHS corporate) and external service integrations.'
