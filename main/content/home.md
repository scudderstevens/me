    shortDescription: 'A static site generator, pulling content from Sanity, to create campaign micro-sites. Each micro-site is a single page with campaign specific information and a contact form. After a form is submitted, a user is forwarded to a thank you page with supplimental call-to-actions such as FAQs or instructional videos. The platform supports Acute Care, IPM, Behavior Health and Corporate marketing campaigns, all while maintianing HIPAA compliance.'
    fullDescription: 'The Campaign Landing Page Platform (CLPP) provides a robust and automated platform to build static file <html> pages. The platform can spin up Landing/Thank You page pairs; for paid radio, pay-per-cick or television advertisements. The CLPP supports campaigns for healthcare systems to individual healthcare locations, across all healthcare verticals.
    The platform is built to handle roughly 300 unique campaigns per year and up to 10,000 submissions per month. Form submissions are handled by the Universal Health Services Referral Registration Team. Name/email addresses are automatically migrated into ActiveCampaign, a customer relationship management system, for subsequent email newsletters. This whole process maintains end -to- end HIPAA compliance; to protect sensitive patient information, while providing actionable marketing data and a clear return on investment.'
